# CodeKiwi Frontend (Slide-Syncer)

> The interactive classroom interface for [CodeKiwi](https://codekiwi.tech), where teachers and students code and learn together in real time.

## Overview
The CodeKiwi frontend powers the live classroom experience:
- **Student View:** Synchronized slides on the left, Monaco code editor + terminal on the right.  
- **Teacher View:** Slide controls, session management, and live student code previews.  
- Built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **TailwindCSS**, communicating with the backend via WebSocket.

## Role in the CodeKiwi Ecosystem
